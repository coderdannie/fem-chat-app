## What I learned

My greatest challenge while building this project is positioning elements in the right place without negatively affecting the site's responsiveness. it took some time before I was able to make the site responsive.
Am not really good at CSS animation yet and I hope the little that I could add makes sense. I learnt how to position element in css
